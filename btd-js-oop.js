// Gameplay: Dealer starts with one card face up. Player guesses whether the next card dealt will be higher or lower in value. If the guess is correct, the dealer draws another card, and the player makes another guess. If incorrect, the player loses, and the game ends. The objective is to get as many correct guesses in a row. //
